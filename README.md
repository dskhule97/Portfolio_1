# [FIFA Player Analysis using python](https://github.com/dskhule97/FIFA-player-data-analysis)
The aim of this project is to perform Data Wrangling, Cleaning and Player Analysis of the FIFA 21 data from Kaggle using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) 

# [Exploratory Data Analysis using Python](https://github.com/dskhule97/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-using-Python)
EDA assists Data science professionals in various ways:-

1. Getting a better understanding of data
2. Identifying various data patterns
3. Getting a better understanding of the problem statement

In this project, I have used Python to perform EDA or Exploratory data analysis on cars dataset.

# [Analyze A/B Test results](https://github.com/dskhule97/AB-testing-using-probability-and-regression)
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. This project involved working through a Jupyter Notebook to answer a series of questions.

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

For this project, I have created a Covid world data dashboard, to showcase my skills like SQL and Tableau.

# [Analysis of Economic Data](https://github.com/dskhule97/World-economic-data-analysis)
The following datasets were wrangled using Python:

- GDP by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
- Citizen Income Per Capita $ Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
- Electricity consumption per person
- Number of cellphones owned per 100 people
- % of internet users by country
- Total annual oil consumption per country
